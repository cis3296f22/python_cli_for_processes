# Python CLI  structure

## Basic Description

This repo serves as a good reference point for a simple and basic CLI
structure. As of now it jsut gets arguments from the commandline, but everything
will be built upon this one function. This code can be run on any MacOS that 
has Python installed because it uses basic Python libraries on version 0.1.0.

This project utlizes an open source, but will not conrtibute to it. It will
become its own CLI tool. 


# Compiling
To compile this code clone the repository to any IDE that can run Python. 
The main() program can be executed, and will search for command line arguments
when run in the terminal.
